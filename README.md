# Quine_McCluskey_C-
Quine McCluskey Algorithm Implemented in C++

This C++ implementation aims to find the minimum SOP form of Boolean expressions efficiently and thus provides a practical alternative to either the manual use of Karnaugh maps or the algorithm itself. It also makes the handling of functions containing more than six variables considerably easier. In this implementation, readability and reusability have been the main design drivers while trying to avoid inefficiencies inherent in the algorithm.
